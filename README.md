## ðŸš€ Capstone Project: Northwind Trade Company

For this capstone project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of the Northwind Trade Company dataset. The goal was to extract strategic insights that could improve the companyâ€™s operational efficiency, customer retention, and profitability. I employed **SQL, Python**, and **Power BI** to query, analyze, and visualize the data.

### ðŸ“Š Project Summary:

### 1. **Overall KPIs:**
   I evaluated key performance indicators (KPIs) including:
   - **Total Orders**: 830
   - **Gross Sales**: $1.4M
   - **Net Sales**: $1.3M
   - **Total Quantity Sold**: 51.3K units
   
   These metrics helped in summarizing the company's overall performance, giving a top-down view of sales and profitability.

### 2. **Customer and Product Analysis:**   
   I analyzed customer data to determine the **top 10 customers by order value**, where **Germany** and the **USA** showed the highest number of customers. I also identified the **best-selling products** and visualized the sales distribution across product categories like Beverages, Dairy Products, and Confections.

### 3. **Category and Product Performance:**
   - Analyzed sales volume, net profit, and discount rates per product category. Beverages and Dairy Products led in terms of profitability, contributing significantly to the companyâ€™s gross and net revenue.
   - Visualized **top 5 categories by total quantity sold** and **monthly sales trends** to identify peak seasons and high-performing categories.

### 4. **Regional and Country-Level Analysis:**
   I examined the company's performance across **21 countries** and **19 regions**. Using SQL queries, I drilled down into each country to measure sales, shipping costs, and profit. Insights from this analysis allowed me to identify opportunities for expanding into regions with high growth potential.

### 5. **Visual Dashboards with Power BI:**
   - Used Power BI for creating interactive dashboards to represent data visually. This enabled a deeper understanding of trends across sales, customer demographics, product performance, and geographical distribution.
   - A key insight was drawn from analyzing **shipping costs** and **total net revenue** per category, optimizing supply chain operations.

### ðŸ›  **Tools Used:**
- **SQL**: For querying and managing the Northwind database.
- **Python**: For data cleaning, transformation, and performing advanced analyses.
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
